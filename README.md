A seminar tutorial on using Cloud AI's image recognition services to locate a user indoors.

Please note: This is only the main repository. You will need to use the 4 other local repositories that hold all of the training images and organize them into their respective folders (e.g., name the folders "G1", "G2", "G3", "G4").
